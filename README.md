# üß™ Threat Detection & Incident Response Lab: PowerShell Suspicious Web Request

This lab walks through the lifecycle of a detection and response scenario where PowerShell is used to download scripts from a remote server using `Invoke-WebRequest`. The goal is to detect, investigate, and respond using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Microsoft Sentinel, and the NIST 800-61 Incident Response framework.

---

## üåü Objective

* Detect suspicious PowerShell use for remote file downloads
* Simulate the activity on an MDE-onboarded host
* Configure a detection rule in Microsoft Sentinel
* Investigate alerts and associated artifacts
* Perform containment, remediation, and reporting actions

---

## üß∞ Preparation

Attackers commonly use legitimate tools like PowerShell to evade detection, leveraging commands such as `Invoke-WebRequest` to download payloads. This technique is part of **LOLBins** (Living Off the Land Binaries). In this lab, we simulate such behavior by downloading `eicar.ps1` (a harmless test file).

Defender for Endpoint detects the behavior and sends telemetry to Microsoft Sentinel for detection and response.

## üõ°Ô∏è Create Alert Rule: Suspicious PowerShell Web Request

### üîç Detection Context

`Invoke-WebRequest` is frequently abused by attackers to:

* Download malicious files or scripts
* Execute payloads post-compromise
* Communicate with external infrastructure (C2)

### üìä Detection Pipeline

1. **MDE logs** PowerShell activity in `DeviceProcessEvents`
2. Logs are **forwarded to Sentinel** via Log Analytics
3. A **scheduled alert rule** in Sentinel detects the behavior

---

### üîß Step-by-Step Detection Setup

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Query Defender Logs

Run the following in Log Analytics Workspace to locate `Invoke-WebRequest` usage:

```kql
let TargetDevice = "nessa-windows";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetDevice
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
```

Verify payload detection. ‚úÖ

```kql
let TargetHostname = "nessa-windows";
let ScriptNames = dynamic(["eicar.ps1", "exfiltratedata.ps1", "portscan.ps1", "pwncrypt.ps1"]);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetHostname
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-File" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (ScriptNames)
| summarize Count = count() by AccountName, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Alert Rule in Sentinel

1. Go to **Microsoft Sentinel > Analytics > Create > Scheduled Query Rule**
2. Fill in:

   * **Name**: PowerShell Suspicious Web Request
   * **Description**: Detects PowerShell downloading remote files
   * **KQL**:

```kql
let TargetDevice = "nessa-windows";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetDevice
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
```

3. **Frequency**: Every 4 hours
   **Lookup Period**: Last 24 hours
4. **Entity Mapping**:

   * `AccountName`, `DeviceName`, `ProcessCommandLine`
5. **MITRE Tactic**: Credential Access / Execution
6. **Enable** and save the rule

## üõ†Ô∏è Work the Incident (NIST 800-61 Lifecycle)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Preparation

* Confirm access, tooling, training

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Detection & Analysis

* Assign incident and mark Active
* Investigate:

```plaintext
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <URL> -OutFile <Path>
```

* Identify scripts:

  * `portscan.ps1`, `pwncrypt.ps1`, `eicar.ps1`, `exfiltratedata.ps1`
* Gather evidence and validate intent (user or threat)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Containment & Recovery

* Isolate host using MDE
* Run Defender scans
* Remove malicious files, validate host state

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Incident

* Log scripts executed
* Note involved user (`system-user`)
* Update PowerShell usage policy
* Enhance training
* Mark incident **True Positive** and close
